Hi

Purpose: To create a reselling chrome extension that speeds up retail online reselling decision making for resellers.

Backstory: I used to be a reseller selling thousands of dollars per month of retail goods including exclusive clothing, sneakers, and household items. 
            There are 3 main components to making a reselling decision for profit which are:
            1. How much can I purchase this item for?
            2. How much can I sell this item for?
            3. How fast can I sell it?
            
This project serves to help resellers answer #2 and #3 by using eBay completed listings data through an eBay developer api call that takes an item name given by a user and checks
how often the item has sold in the last 3 months and for what average price.
            
By simply typing in the name of a product into this chrome extension, resellers which would be the target audience, can quickly know if they have a profitable item opportunity.

Languages used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
API: eBay Developer API

How to use:
1. Download the files
2. Get an eBay developer key and add the credentials
3. Upload the file to google chrome extension to be able to add to your browser
4. Apply the google chrome extension permissions
